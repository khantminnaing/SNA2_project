# Social Network Analysis Project

### Introduction 
This project investigates about the state of political bi-partisanship in light of the 2006 United States elections and analyse the purchasing patterns of people to political books the other side of the spectrum. Understanding which nodes are the most central to the network could also give an indication of how ideas and opinions are bridged


### Dataset 
This project use the dataset of a network of books about US politics published around the time of the 2004 presidential election and sold by the online bookseller Amazon.com. Edges between books represent frequent copurchasing of books by the same buyers. The network was compiled by V. Krebs and is unpublished, but can found on Krebs' web site (http://www.orgnet.com/).
